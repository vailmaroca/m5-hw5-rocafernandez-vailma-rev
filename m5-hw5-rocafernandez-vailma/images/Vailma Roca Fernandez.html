                <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic and grew up with my parents and older sister. My dad's ancestors are from Castile and Leon, while others are of Jewish Sephardic descent. My mom is from San Francisco in the north of the island and works as a journalist, art critic, and freelance writer for newspapers in Santo Domingo.</p>
                <p>After graduating, I studied law and earned my juris doctorate in 2002. In 2004, I moved to the United States and gained experience in sales, administration, immigration, and tax law while working with an Italian company in Miami, Florida.</p>
                <p>2018, I divorced and moved with my daughter to Gainesville, FL. As part of my healing process, I returned to school and obtained my second BA in Education Sciences. I had always dreamt of becoming an educator, and finally, after moving to Alachua, Florida, I secured a stable job in a school district.</p>
                <p>In 2023, after the pandemic, I graduated from the University of Florida, a significant achievement in my life. At 49 years old, I was proud to have earned my second degree from one of the most prestigious public universities in the country.</p>
                <p>I come from a family of journalists and writers. I also wrote articles for a local newspaper in San Francisco, DR. I wrote about my magical childhood with my friends and family and the strong values that have endured in my family, giving me hope for a better world.</p>
                <p>Inspired by my family's background, I pursued a master's in journalism to continue my passion for writing. I aim to start my blog by incorporating my values and work ethic and writing without bias on topics I'm interested in. I found MMC5277 to be an excellent resource to learn and work on my storytelling projects, including writing about life and being a mother with ADHD, Asperger's, and having an autistic child.</p>
                <p>My diagnoses of ADHD and Asperger's came after I became a mother. I struggled with concentration and understanding essential things in life. After consulting with a psychiatrist and a neurologist, I finally understood why I was different but not less.</p>
                <p>I have many projects now, including writing about my condition and how I thrived after the diagnosis, as well as sharing my experience of raising a child with autism while having similar situations. I believe we can overcome these challenges, and I aim to prove it.</p>
